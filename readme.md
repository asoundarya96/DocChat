## Features

- **Interacting with Documents**: Upload your documents via the Gradio interface and start a chat session to interact with the uploaded documents.

## Implementation

- **Chat Interface**: Built using Gradio for a user-friendly UI.
- **Language Model Interaction**: Utilizes LangChain framework for interacting with a local LLM (Large Language Model) powered by Ollama.
- **API**: Exposed using FastAPI for document uploads and chat.

## Database Setup

Embedding and collection tables are auto-generated by LangChain functions.

### Documents Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE documents (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    document BYTEA,
    embedding VECTOR(384) -- Set dimensions based on embed model
);
